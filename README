This is a hack from http://github.com/yfactorial/objectiveresource.git.

The purpose of this is to add form based serialization, which allows for the uploading of as many files as you want.


This obviously should have been a clone of ryan's project, but by the time I got around to writing this "patch" I had already deviated from their branch in significant ways (mostly folder structure, and it drove me nuts that the sample app was tied in so tight).

The code doesn't devaiate too much, so it shouldn't be too hard for someone capable to get this into their master. the main thing I added was the Form serialization stuff, which is the important thing. I think if you pretty much drop that dir in and add a few imports if should work.

I also want to give credit to another branch of OR by someone i can't remember, but that's where I got the original ORBinary class.

I hope my little work here continues my tradition of making Ryan both love me and hate me. ;)
